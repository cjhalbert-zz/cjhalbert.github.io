However, many coaches don\u2019t want knuckleball pitchers, as they don\u2019t think it is a respectable way to play the game of baseball (Memmott, 2019). Similarly, in the sport of basketball, the shot clock was introduced to deter players from not attempting shots.

"),r.a.createElement("h3",null,"DEFINITIONS"),r.a.createElement("p",null,"In this article, I want to dive as deeply as possible into what gimmicks are, and how they affect people's interaction with sports, media, and the Internet. I think before we jump into that however, we need to define what a gimmick is. This is much more complicated as it sounds though. The concept of gimmicks is an incredibly nuanced and layered one. Before we even begin to define what gimmicks are, we need to define a few other terms. "),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The first term that I\u2019d like to define to begin to set the stage for talking about gimmicks is the concept of ",r.a.createElement("b",null,"novelty"),". Novelty, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is, \u201cThe quality of being new or unusual\u201d (Merriam-Webster, 2019). Novelty seems deeper than this though. I would expand this definition to be, \u201cThe quality of being new, unusual, surprising, or unique.\u201d I think novelty implies surprise and uniqueness. We call things new or unusual all the time without thinking of them as ",r.a.createElement("i",null,"novel. "),"In order for us to label something as being a novelty, it needs to surprise us by being different from what we normally expect.

"),"I want to define value specifically as it relates to devices or ideas, or products and services. As with novelty, I\u2019ll start with the Merriam-Webster definition, as It\u2019s a good springboard into further analysis. Merriam-Webster defines value as, \u201cRelative worth, utility, or importance\u201d or, \u201cSomething (such as a principle or quality) intrinsically valuable or desirable\u201d (Merriam-Webster, 2019). I think the latter definition is especially important when discussing value as related to gimmicks. These definitions imply that value is inherent in everything. That everything is on some scale or spectrum of desirability or importance, and that this value is naturally of the thing itself. I think that I would change this definition as well to reflect the environment that I will be analyzing gimmicks in. I would change this definition to say that value is something inherent in the person viewing or analyzing the device, idea, product, or service. All consumers, users, or people hold different things in different light, and thus, we assign value to different things differently. I\u2019d say that value is the importance that an individual places on a device or idea based on their experiences, needs, and background.\u201d"),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The third and most important concept that we need to define before jumping into how gimmicks are defined is the concept of ",r.a.createElement("b",null,"attention"),". The Merriam-Webster definition for attention states that it is, \u201cThe act or state of applying the mind to something\u201d or, \u201ca condition of readiness for such attention involving especially a selective narrowing or focusing of consciousness and receptivity.\u201d I think that this definition applies fairly well to how I\u2019m defining gimmicks for this paper, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll add anything to it. I do want to stress however the importance of attention, and its connection to novelty and value. Attention itself isn\u2019t a property of gimmicks like novelty or value, it\u2019s more a product of gimmicks. Or possibly the goal. Attention is what results from a successful gimmick. "),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Now that we\u2019ve defined novelty, value, and attention, we can move on to describing how these three concepts intersect to create a ",r.a.createElement("b",null,"gimmick"),". For the final time, we\u2019ll start with the Merriam-Webster definition. The dictionary has several definitions, already showing how complicated the term is. The first definition states that a gimmick is, \u201cA mechanical device for secretly and dishonestly controlling gambling apparatus.\u201d Or, \u201cAn ingenious or novel mechanical device.\u201d This isn\u2019t really how we\u2019re defining gimmicks. The synonym \u201cGadget\u201d is supplied here, which doesn\u2019t seem to fit. The second definition says, \u201cAn important feature that is not immediately apparent.\u201d This gets more towards how I\u2019m trying to define gimmicks. I would say that gimmicks are not always important, and sometimes they are incredibly apparent and obvious. The third definition says, \u201cAn ingenious and usually new scheme or angle,\u201d and the fourth definition says, \u201cA trick or device used to attract business or attention.\u201d These last two definitions are getting much more to how I see gimmicks. Gimmicks are often novel and ingenious; they capture people\u2019s attention based on their uniqueness and element of surprise. Gimmicks are also often thought of as tricks or devices. They are thought to be cheap or tacky, or somehow disingenuous."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"I think that these definitions paint a pretty good picture of what gimmicks are, and provide a good basis for how I\u2019ll be examining the different gimmicks presented in this article."),r.a.createElement("h3",null,"SPORTS"),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Sports and competition are an area where gimmicks are incredibly prominent.

Usually these techniques employ strategies that rely on unique or unorthodox play that isn\u2019t seen very often, or they rely on their opponent not knowing how to react or combat their technique. Most of these types of strategies and techniques are looked down upon or discouraged in their respective competitive communities.

Jumpers initially would simply run towards the bar and attempt to leap straight over it, or would attempt to lift one leg over first and roll their body over the bar. However, at the 1968 Summer Olympics, American high jumper Dick Fosbury took home the gold medal by utilizing a technique now referred to as, \u201cThe Fosbury Flop.\u201d The technique involved jumping over the bar backwards, head and shoulders first, and flopping on to the mat behind the bar.

This is probably why we are so aware when individuals or corporations pervert those media, and use them in novel ways.

"),r.a.createElement("p",null,"One of the most prominent examples of this is the use of sales and markdowns to sell products. Often times retailers will markdown the price of some of their products in order to sell them faster. The retailer will make less profit off of each individual sale, but there will be more sales, thus increasing profit on possibly less desirable products. This will often happen with items that are approaching expiration dates, or with items that need to be cleared out or gotten rid of. Sometimes however, sales are applied to products misleadingly. Furniture stores in particular often will create sales off of the MSRP (Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price) instead of the actual sale price. This causes sales to look much more appealing. For example: If a recliner\u2019s MSRP is $1000 but usually sells closer to $600, a furniture store might decide to sell it at $300 and say it\u2019s 70% off MSRP instead of 50% off sale price.

Retailers and marketing and advertising companies will use sales to further advertise their products. Huge billboards with percent signs and numbers on them are constantly up outside businesses and on highways.

Gimmicks on the internet aren\u2019t necessarily to increase sales, or to gain the upper hand in competition. Gimmicks on the Internet are often used to keep people on the sites that they are using, or to increase engagement with the site\u2019s content, or to even increase enjoyment with the site. When the internet first became popular, gimmicks were everywhere. Audio playing when you loaded the site, guest books, site visit counters, obnoxiously patterned backgrounds, bright fonts and colors, etc. There were countless gimmicks employed by countless sites in order to stand out. Take a look at the old website promoting the movie Space Jam:"),r.a.createElement("figure",null,r.a.createElement("img",{src:Qt.a,alt:""})),r.a.createElement("p",null,"This was a common site on the early internet.

Small interactions or animations have replaced huge spectacles and loud music. On Twitter for example, when you like a Tweet, a small confetti animation plays. On Facebook, the status update text box reads, \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d before you type anything. Google has an endless amount of Easter eggs buried in Google Maps, the Google search engine, and all of their various other products. These gimmicks aren\u2019t in your face anymore, they are pleasant and low key. "),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Not all of these gimmicks are pleasant however. Another form of gimmick on the web has risen in recent years that aims to take advantage of users. These gimmicks, referred to as dark UI patterns, trick users into signing up for things that they don\u2019t want to, go to sites that they didn\u2019t mean to go to, and generally do things that the users don\u2019t necessarily want to do. Some of these patterns (pulled from darkpatterns.org, an organization aiming to spread awareness of the patterns) include commerce sites slipping additional products into your purchase basket before you buy, hidden fees and costs, timed and unavoidable popups, and clickable advertisements that look like buttons or navigational elements. These patterns take advantage of our sense of what is normal and expected on the internet."),r.a.createElement("h3",null,"CONCLUSION"),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Gimmicks get a bad reputation. We see them everyday, and they seem cheap, or forced, and often times they are. But I think that gimmicks are misunderstood.
